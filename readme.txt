This website is mainly used to create an appealing story to get an Apprenticeship next year.
That means structuring and designing an interesting website to showcase my skills and personality.
Content:
 - embedded videos to showcase my personality
 - projects tab
   (raspberrypi, website, python bot??)
 - goodreads tab
 - blog/gedanken/philosophie tab
 
Design will be:
 - clean
 - focused on images
 - bright colors

I will use this website to learn HTML/CSS and JavaScript. This will also be improving my state of mind. Creating self worth and working towards a set goal.
Deadline for this Project will be 1/10/2020
